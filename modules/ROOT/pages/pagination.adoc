= Pagination

You can use the `limit` argument to limit the number of results you want returned from a query, and the `offset` argument to specify which slice of the results you want returned.

For example, the following query sorts its results in ascending order by the `name` property, and only returns the first three results:

[source,graphql]
----
{
  DemoGraph {
    person (
      order_by : {name : asc},
      limit : 3
    )
       {name,
       gender,
       height
    }
  }
}
----

Using the `offset` argument, we can specify the number of results to skip.
The following query sorts its results in ascending order by the `name` property, only returns three results and skips the first result:

[source,graphql]
----
{
  DemoGraph {
    person (
      order_by : {name : asc},
      limit : 3,
      offset : 1
    )
       {name,
       gender,
       height
    }
  }
}
----

== Limitations
The following limitations apply to pagination in TigerGraph GraphQL service:

* When a query uses `limit` with `offset`, it must also use the xref:sorting.adoc[`order_by`] argument.
* In a multi-hop query, pagination is only supported on root-level queries.
