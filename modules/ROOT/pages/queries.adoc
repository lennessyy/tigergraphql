:description: How to write GraphQL queries

In TigerGraph GraphQL service, you can create GraphQL queries to fetch specific fields of vertices and edges in a graph.

NOTE: In the context of TigerGraph GraphQL service, a query usually refers to a GraphQL query, as opposed to a TigerGraph query.
If we

For example, if we have the following schema in TigerGraph:

.Example schema
image::example-schema.png[Example schema]

== One-hop pattern
We can write the following query to find all the people and their birthday and birth city.

query {
  DemoGraph {
    person {
      name
      birthday
      born_in {
        to {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

2 people are found with their names and birthday, one in Mountain View and another in Palo Alto:
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "data": {
    "DemoGraph": {
      "person": [
        {
          "born_in": [
            {
              "birthday": "1995-01-01 00:00:00",
              "to": {
                "name": "palo alto"
              }
            }

          "name": "Jenny"

        {
          "born_in": [
            {
              "birthday": "1973-10-05 00:00:00",
              "to": {
                "name": "mountain view"
              }
            }
          ],
          "name": "Smith"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "errors": null
}

== N-hop patterns
In a GraphQL query, you can traverse multiple edges in a single request by nesting in the `to` field of edge objects.

If we expand on the previous 1-hop query, we can perform multiple hops in a single query.
On top of a person's name and their birth city, we can write the following query to also fetch the school they attend and the city in which the school is located.
