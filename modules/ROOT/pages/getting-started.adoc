= Quickstart
:experimental:
:sectnums:

This quickstart walks you through:

. Setting up a TigerGraph schema and loading data to a TigerGraph instance.
. Running an instance of TigerGraph GraphQL service and connecting to the graph in the TigerGraph instance.
. Running GraphQL queries against the service.
. (Optional) Running a web application built on top of the service

You can view the walk-through in video format:

== Download example solution and data
. Download the https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/TigerGraphQL/raw/0.7/tigergraphql_example_solution.tar.gz[example TigerGraph solution].
. Download the https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/TigerGraphQL/raw/0.7/tigergraphql_example_data.zip[example data set] and unzip it.

== Load data
. Start up a TigerGraph instance, either xref:tigergraph-server:getting-started:docker.adoc[locally] or on xref:cloud:start:getting-started.adoc[TigerGraph Cloud].
. Navigate to the GraphStudio homepage and click btn:[Import an Existing Solution]. Select the `.tar.gz` file you downloaded in the previous step/.
* If you are running TigerGraph locally, you can access GraphStudio by visiting http://localhost:14240.
* If you are running your instance on TigerGraph Cloud, you can xref:cloud:access-solution:graphstudio.adoc[navigate to GraphStudio through the Cloud portal] or visit your Cloud instance URL.

. In the upper left corner of the GraphStudio Home page, click menu:Global View[DemoGraph] to switch to the demo graph.
. On the left-side navigation, click btn:[Map Data To Graph], which should no longer be grayed out after switching out of global view.
. Click the btn:[Add Data File] button and upload all the `.csv` files from the decompressed data folder.

.Add data file
image::add-data-file.png[Add data file]
. Navigate to the Load Data page by clicking btn:[Load Data] on the left-side navigation menu.
Click the btn:[▶] button in the toolbar above the canvas to start data loading.

After data loading completes, your graph is ready for use.

== Start TigerGraph GraphQL Service
. Download the service binary:

|===

. Start the service
+
[tabs]
====
Linux/MacOS::
+
--
. Decompress the tarball, and there will be a binary named `tigergraphql`.
. Run the following command from the terminal to start the service and connect to the TigerGraph instance:
+
[source.wrap,console]
----
$ ./tigergraphql -s http://<url_to_tigergraph:port> -p 4000 -u tigergraph -w tigergraph -g DemoGraph <1> <2> <3> <4> <5>
----
<1> `-s`: The TigerGraph server URL
<2> `-p`: The port TigerGraph GraphQL Service is served on
<3> `-u`: GSQL username
<4> `-w`: GSQL password
<5> `-g`: The name of the graph to connect to
--
Windows::
+
--
. Unzip the file, and there will be a file named `tigergraphql.exe`.
. Run the executable with the following command to start the service and connect to the TigerGraph instance:
+
[source.wrap,console]
----
tigergraphql.exe -s http://<url_to_tigergraph:port> -p 4000 -u tigergraph -w tigergraph -g DemoGraph <1> <2> <3> <4> <5>
----
<1> `-s`: The TigerGraph server URL and port for GraphStudio
<2> `-p`: The port TigerGraph GraphQL Service is served on
<3> `-u`: GSQL username
<4> `-w`: GSQL password
<5> `-g`: The name of the graph to connect to
--
====
+
The URL and port is the URL and port to access GraphStudio in the browser.
If you are accessing a TigerGraph Cloud instance, you will need to use `https` instead of `http`, and you do not need to specify the port.

If the connection is successful, you will see in the terminal that the schema is loaded and that the service is being served.
Now you can access the GraphQL API from the browser at the URL and port you specified:

== Run a query
Having set up the GraphQL service, now let's try running a simple query against the API.
You'll learn about running GraphQL queries on TigerGraph in more depth in the xref:queries.adoc[Queries section].
For now, let's run a simple query to get all person vertices in the graph and where they are born:

[tabs]
====
Query::
+
--
[source,graphql]
----
query {
  DemoGraph {
    person {
      name
      born_in {
        birthday
        to {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

== Programmatically run a GraphQL query
The GraphQL service UI is a quick way to validate the query result.
To programmatically run a GraphQL query or integrate with your application, you need to provide credentials to authenticate your requests.
You can authenticate by including encrypted credentials in HTTP headers.

Type your TigerGraph username and password in the following format, with the two strings separated by a colon: `<username>:<password>`.
For example, if your username is tigergraph and your password is password, it should be `tigergraph:password`.

Encode `<username>:<password>` using base64 encoding. In this example, you get `dGlnZXJncmFwaDpwYXNzd29yZA==`

Use this curl command to test it out:

[source.wrap, console]
----
curl --header “Authorization: Basic dGlnZXJncmFwaDpwYXNzd29yZA==” -X POST <TigerGraph-domain>:<port>/api/graphql/gsql/DemoGraph -d ‘{“query”:”query { DemoGraph { person { name born_in { birthday to { name } } } } }”, "variables": null}’
----

== (Optional) Run a GraphQL-powered web application
You can run our example React app built on top our demo data and explore how a front-end application interacts with a GraphQL API.

. Download link:https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/TigerGraphQL/raw/0.7/tigergraphql_example_react.zip[the example application], unzip the file and change directory into the `tigergraphql_example_react` folder
. If TigerGraph GraphQL Service is running on another machine, change `config.json` with the IP and port to that machine.
If the service is running on localhost, skip this step.
+
[source,javascript]
----
{
    "GRAPHQL_API": "http://localhost:4000/graphql" <1>
}

----
<1> Change the root url to the IP and port that the service is running on
. Run the following command to serve the app:
+
[source,console]
----
$ python server.py
serving at port 3000
