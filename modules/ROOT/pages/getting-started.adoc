= Quickstart
:experimental:
:sectnums:

This quickstart walks you through:

. Setting up a TigerGraph schema and loading data to a TigerGraph instance.
. Access TigerGraph GraphQL service and connecting to the graph in the TigerGraph instance.
. Running GraphQL queries against the service.
. (Optional) Running a web application built on top of the service

== Download example solution and data
. Download the https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/TigerGraphQL/raw/0.9/tigergraphql_example_solution.tar.gz[example TigerGraph solution].
. Download the https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/TigerGraphQL/raw/0.9/tigergraphql_example_data.zip[example data set] and unzip it.

== Load data
. Start up a TigerGraph instance, either xref:tigergraph-server:getting-started:docker.adoc[locally] or on xref:cloud:start:overview.adoc[TigerGraph Cloud].
. Navigate to the GraphStudio homepage and click btn:[Import an Existing Solution]. Select the `.tar.gz` file you downloaded in the previous step/.
* If you are running TigerGraph locally, you can access GraphStudio by visiting http://localhost:14240 and select GraphStudio.
* If you are running your instance on TigerGraph Cloud, you can xref:cloud:access-solution:graphstudio.adoc[navigate to GraphStudio through the Cloud portal] or visit your Cloud instance URL.

. In the upper left corner of the GraphStudio Home page, click menu:Global View[DemoGraph] to switch to the demo graph.
. On the left-side navigation, click btn:[Map Data To Graph], which should no longer be grayed out after switching out of global view.
. Click the btn:[Add Data File] button and upload all the `.csv` files from the decompressed data folder.
Click btn:[Publish data mapping] to publish data mapping.
+
.Add data file
image::add-data-file.png[Add data file]
. Navigate to the Load Data page by clicking btn:[Load Data] on the left-side navigation menu.
Click the btn:[▶] button in the toolbar above the canvas to start data loading.

After data loading completes, your graph is ready for use.

== Access TigerGraph GraphQL Service
To access the GraphQL service, click the nine-dot icon in the top right corner of the screen and click GraphQL.

Right under the top pane in the up right corner, select the graph you want to query against.
In this case, we'll select DemoGraph.

.GraphQL API in browser

== Run a query

Let's try running a simple query against the API.
You'll learn about running GraphQL queries on TigerGraph in more depth in the xref:queries.adoc[Queries section].
For now, let's run a simple query to get all person vertices in the graph and where they are born:

== Programmatically run a GraphQL query
The GraphQL service UI is a quick way to validate the query result.
To programmatically run a GraphQL query or integrate with your application, you need to provide credentials to authenticate your requests.
You can authenticate by including encrypted credentials in HTTP headers.

Type your TigerGraph username and password in the following format, with the two strings separated by a colon: `<username>:<password>`.
For example, if your username is tigergraph and your password is password, it should be `tigergraph:password`.

Encode `<username>:<password>` using base64 encoding. In this example, you get `dGlnZXJncmFwaDpwYXNzd29yZA==`

Use this curl command to test it out:

[source.wrap, console]
----
curl --header “Authorization: Basic dGlnZXJncmFwaDpwYXNzd29yZA==” -X POST <TigerGraph-domain>:<port>/api/graphql/gsql/DemoGraph -d ‘{“query”:”query { DemoGraph { person { name born_in { birthday to { name } } } } }”, "variables": null}’
----
//
//== (Optional) Run a GraphQL-powered web application
//You can run our example React app built on top our demo data and explore how a front-end application interacts with a GraphQL API.
//
//. Download link:https://github.com/TigerGraph-DevLabs/TigerGraphQL/raw/0.7/tigergraphql_example_react.zip[the example application], unzip the file and change directory into the `tigergraphql_example_react` folder
//. If TigerGraph GraphQL Service is running on another machine, change `config.json` with the IP and port to that machine.
//If the service is running on localhost, skip this step.
//+
//[source,javascript]
//----
//{
//    "GRAPHQL_API": "http://localhost:4000/graphql" <1>
//}
//
//----
//<1> Change the root url to the IP and port that the service is running on
//. Run the following command to serve the app:
//+
//[source,console]
//----
//$ python server.py
//serving at port 3000
